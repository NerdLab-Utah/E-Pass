# E-PASS: A Modern, Digital Cognitive Independence Assessment for Daily Living Tasks

## Overview

**E-PASS** (Electronic Performance Assessment of Self-care Skills) is a digital adaptation of the traditional PASS (Performance Assessment of Self-care Skills). It is designed to evaluate cognitive-functional independence in modern daily living tasks and is especially useful in telehealth where a physical test may be impractical. By replacing outdated activities with modern equivalents, E-PASS brings occupational therapy assessment into the 21st century.

## Abstract

When a physician assesses a patient's ability to perform activities of daily living (ADLs), they often rely on the PASS—a widely accepted, evidence-based tool. However, tasks like checkbook balancing are no longer representative of contemporary living. E-PASS modernizes this by:

- Replacing outdated ADLs with modern equivalents
- Supporting remote and self-guided assessment
- Maintaining evidence-based scoring and performance assessment

E-PASS offers increased **functional relevance**, **greater accessibility**, and enhanced **usability** through a disability-friendly interface.

## Why E-PASS?

- Evidence-based design grounded in the original PASS framework
- Modernized tasks for today's activities of daily living 
- Remote-accessible for telehealth or underserved settings  
- Accessibility-first user interface  

> _“E-PASS helps bridge the gap between traditional assessments and the realities of modern digital life.”_
